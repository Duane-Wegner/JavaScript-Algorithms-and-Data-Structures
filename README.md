# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Portfolio

## üß† About

This repository contains a collection of projects built as part of the [freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/).

These projects demonstrate core JavaScript skills, including algorithmic thinking, DOM manipulation, object-oriented and functional programming, local storage usage, asynchronous JavaScript, and more.

The goal of this portfolio is to reinforce and apply foundational JavaScript knowledge through hands-on, interactive projects.

## üí° Features

- Pure JavaScript implementations (no frameworks)
- Hands-on approach to learning modern JS fundamentals
- Strong focus on algorithms, logic, and interactivity
- Real-world project applications

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
  Core language used throughout all lessons and projects.

- **HTML5** *(used optionally in browser-based projects)*  
  Required in projects involving forms or layout such as:
    - Palindrome Checker
    - Calorie Counter
    - Cash Register
    - RPG Creature Search App

- **CSS3** *(optional for styling browser-based projects)*  
  Not required by the curriculum, but helpful for:
    - Improving UI/UX in interactive projects
    - Personalizing project appearance (e.g., Rock, Paper, Scissors UI)

- **DOM API**  
  Used to create interactive elements and respond to user input in:
    - Rock, Paper, Scissors
    - Calorie Counter
    - Palindrome Checker
    - Dice Game
    - Shopping Cart

- **Browser APIs (localStorage, fetch)**  
  Used in asynchronous and stateful projects:
    - Todo App (`localStorage`)
    - fCC Authors Page (`fetch`)
    - fCC Forum Leaderboard (`fetch`)
    - RPG Creature Search App (`fetch`)

- **freeCodeCamp‚Äôs Test Suite**  
  Automatically validates project requirements and completion. Required for all certification projects.
